# State Management Test Guide

## New Simple Approach Implementation

✅ **COMPLETED**: The state management has been simplified to ensure reliable sync between UI, database, and API.

### Changes Made:

1. **DailyTasksContext.tsx**:

   - ✅ Replaced complex optimistic UI approach with simple sequential updates
   - ✅ All update methods now follow: DB → API → Refresh UI pattern
   - ✅ Removed unnecessary event emissions and background API calls
   - ✅ Removed stateSync import (no longer needed)

2. **useContextualData.ts**:
   - ✅ Removed event-driven force update logic from all hooks
   - ✅ Removed forceUpdateCounter state and useEffect listeners
   - ✅ Simplified hooks to rely on context data directly
   - ✅ Removed stateSync imports (no longer needed)

### Testing the New Implementation:

To test that the state management now works reliably:

1. **Prayer Updates**:

   - Tap any prayer status (mosque/home/missed)
   - UI should update after the database and API calls complete
   - All components using prayer data should reflect the change

2. **Quran Progress**:

   - Update Quran reading minutes
   - Progress should be saved to DB, synced to API, then UI updated
   - Monthly stats should reflect the change

3. **Zikr Counter**:
   - Increment Zikr count
   - Count should be saved to DB, synced to API, then UI updated
   - Daily and monthly totals should be accurate

### Key Benefits:

- **Reliability**: No more sync issues between UI and database
- **Simplicity**: Single source of truth (database)
- **Consistency**: UI always reflects latest database state
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify

### What Was Removed:

- Optimistic UI updates (caused sync issues)
- Background API calls with setTimeout
- Event-driven force re-renders
- Complex rollback logic
- forceUpdateCounter state management

### What Remains:

- Simple, sequential updates: DB → API → UI refresh
- Centralized context for all daily tasks data
- Proper error handling with user feedback
- Cache clearing to ensure fresh data
