# DailyTasksSelector Simplified Test

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Complex Caching**

- Removed dataCache usage in DailyTasksSelector
- Removed complex cache keys and cache invalidation
- Now uses simple useMemo for data transformation

### 2. **Simplified Task Toggle**

- Direct integration with DailyTasksContext methods
- Prayer tasks: Toggle between 'none' and 'mosque'
- Quran tasks: Toggle between 0 and 15 minutes
- Zikr tasks: Toggle between 0 and 100 count

### 3. **Removed Over-Engineering**

- Removed useTaskManager hook complexity
- Removed taskHandler complex logic
- Removed performance optimization that broke functionality
- Removed complex caching system

### 4. **Basic Functionality**

- Simple PagerView with basic pagination
- Direct onTaskToggle that calls context methods
- Clear console logging for debugging

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

1. **Open the app and navigate to Prayer Time screen**
2. **Scroll down to Daily Tasks section**
3. **Check if tasks are clickable on "Today" page**
4. **Verify tasks toggle correctly:**
   - Prayer tasks should show/hide mosque status
   - Quran tasks should toggle 15 minutes
   - Zikr tasks should toggle 100 count
5. **Check if state updates instantly in UI**
6. **Test pagination between days**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior

- âœ… Tasks should be clickable on Today's tab
- âœ… Tasks should show immediate visual feedback
- âœ… State should update instantly before database/API calls
- âœ… Console should show clear debug logs
- âœ… Context state should refresh all related components

## ðŸ”§ Debug Information

Check console for these logs:

- `ðŸ”„ Toggling task [taskId] for date [date]`
- `ðŸ”˜ Task pressed: [taskId], isToday: [boolean]`
- `ðŸ”„ Calling onTaskToggle for [taskId]`
- `âœ… Task toggle completed for [taskId]`

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Simplification

1. **Immediate Functionality** - Tasks are now clickable
2. **Clear Debug Path** - Easy to trace issues
3. **Direct State Management** - No intermediate layers
4. **Maintainable Code** - Simple, readable logic
5. **Fast Performance** - No complex caching overhead
